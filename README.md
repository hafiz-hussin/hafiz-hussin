For this assignment, we are investigating the comovement of stocks from KLSI index. We need some features so that we could assess the comovement between the selected stocks. The proposed 
Analysis Goal:
Each stocks listed in KLSE main market display different patterns in their historical daily prices. Using historical prices of the stocks crawled from 1st January 2017 until 2nd April 2019, cluster them into groups so that a profitable investment stratergy can be build.
steps to do preprocessing.
1. Feature selection – choose only 5 stocks from 13 sectors from Main Market. Total stocks analyzed are 65 stocks out of 777 total stocks crawled. The creteria to select the 5 stocks from each sectors is based on the largest volume. 
2. Time frame – choose one year period from 1/1/2018 – 31/12/2018
3. Identifying null value – removed row
4. smooth the TS – SAX algorithm
5. Run the covariance

p1 : This script was intially used to do exploration data analysis. analysis using raw data, without doing the feature engineering.
p2 : This a fully working script and try to model the data using the actual feature without any feature engineering.
p3 : This script calculates the feature engineering.
p4 : This script performs the modelling of the features after the feature engineering process and produce the accuracy metrics.
